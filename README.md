# Saved Prompt Injector

A Chrome Extension that allows you to **inject commonly used saved prompt snippets** (leaders and trailers) into any active text input area or contentEditable field (such as ChatGPT, Notion, Gmail, etc.).
You can inject via **popup buttons** or by assigning **custom keyboard shortcuts** through the browser‚Äôs Extensions Shortcuts panel.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Popup buttons** for quick injection:

  * Leader (Main)
  * Trailer (Main)
  * Leader (Alt)
  * Trailer (Alt)
* **Custom keyboard shortcuts** (set in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`).
* **Template storage**:

  * Save/edit four templates (leader main, trailer main, leader alt, trailer alt).
  * Templates are persisted in `chrome.storage.sync` (they sync across Chrome installs signed into the same account).
* **Injection logic**:

  * Works in `<textarea>` and `<input>` elements.
  * Works in `contentEditable` fields (e.g., ChatGPT input box).
  * Correct handling of leaders/trailers:

    * Leaders ‚Üí snippet inserted with newline(s) after.
    * Trailers ‚Üí newline(s) before snippet.
* **Options page** for editing templates with a simple form.
* **Lightweight** (no external libraries, just native Chrome APIs).
* **Manifest V3 compliant**.

## üõ† File Overview

* **`manifest.json`**
  Defines extension metadata, permissions, background scripts, popup, options, and command bindings.

* **`background.js`**
  Listens for registered keyboard shortcut commands.
  Fetches the correct template and calls the injection logic (mirrors popup button behaviour).

* **`popup.html` / `popup.js`**
  Renders the popup UI with four buttons + status line.
  Handles button clicks ‚Üí fetches template ‚Üí injects into active tab.

* **`options.html` / `options.js`**
  Provides a UI for editing and saving templates.
  Uses `chrome.storage.sync` so templates persist across devices.

* **`icons/`**
  Contains icon assets in required sizes (16px, 48px, 128px).

---

## üîë Permissions Explained

This extension requests the following permissions in `manifest.json`:

* **`scripting`**
  Required to run injection scripts into the active page.

* **`activeTab`**
  Needed so the extension can interact with the currently focused tab.

* **`storage`**
  Used for persisting user‚Äôs templates (via `chrome.storage.sync`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example Workflow

1. Save a leader template in Options:

   ```
   "Please carefully analyse the following text:"
   ```

2. Save a trailer template in Options:

   ```
   "Summarise in three concise bullet points."
   ```

3. While in ChatGPT, click **Leader (Main)** button ‚Üí text injected, cursor remains ready.

4. Type/paste your input.

5. Use keyboard shortcut for **Trailer (Main)** ‚Üí trailer text appears neatly after with spacing.

---

## üß© Known Behaviours

* Injection spacing differs slightly between `<textarea>` and `contentEditable`:

  * For `<textarea>`: handled with `\n` characters.
  * For `contentEditable`: handled by inserting `<br>` elements.
* Multiple `<br>` are used to simulate blank lines (since raw `\n` won‚Äôt render).
* Cursor position is reset immediately after insertion.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

* **Injection doesn‚Äôt work:**
  Make sure you‚Äôve clicked inside a text box first before triggering.

* **Keyboard shortcut not responding:**
  Check your assignments in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`.
  Some combinations may be blocked/reserved by the OS.

* **Templates not saving:**
  Verify you pressed ‚ÄúSave‚Äù in the Options page.
  If syncing across Chrome profiles, allow time for `chrome.storage.sync` to propagate.

## üí° Future Improvements

* Add more template slots.
* Export/import templates (JSON).
* Per-site template sets (ChatGPT vs Gmail vs Notion).
